A *very simple* stopwatch project made using `HTML`, `CSS`, and vanilla `JavaScript`. An ideal warmup project with space for improvements.

## Introduction
I am Santanu Paul, a student and coding hobbyist from India.

I made this project a few months ago with a time limitation of 30 minutes. Although, I was succesfull in that creating a perfectly working and elegant website for it, I wasn't really satisfied with the code of that project. I was mainly a Python developer back then and didn't have much experience with web technologies. In the past few months, I have improved a lot. Hence, I'm ready to take on this challenge once again.

## Rules
For this challenge, I have come up with a few rules:
- **Time limitation**: I'm going to restrict myself to 30 minutes.
- **Code quality**: I must use proper variable names and follow proper conventions.
- **Documentation**: I must document this project with at least a few commenths and this beautiful `README.md` file.

## How to Run
You can either vist the site for this project directly from this link â€” [click here](https://codingwithsantanu.github.io/stopwatch/), or open the `index.html` file yourself in a modern web browser like Chrome or Edge.

## Result
I finished just under 30 minutes, in 29 minutes. I started the timer from 14:39 and finished my project within 15:08. All the documentation except this section in the README.md file was already done from the start. Overall, it was such a fun project.

I would like to confess that I still suck at styling. I had to waste some time checking what colors I used for the container and the body. I never said I wasn't allowed to do that, did I?
