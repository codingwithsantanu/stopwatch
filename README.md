# Stopwatch
This is a *very simple* stopwatch program made using `HTML`, `CSS`, and vanilla `JS`. You may think that it is just an usual stopwatch program made as a beginner project. Well, that would be correct if there wasn't a time limitation.

## How to Run
You cab either visit the site directly from this link â€” [click here](codingwithsantanu.github.io/stopwatch) or run the `index.html` file directly. I know most of you already knew, but it seems to be a good idea to include this part into the code.

Run this command in your terminal to clone the repository.
``` sh
git clone https://github.com/codingwithsantanu/stopwatch.git
```

Then finally open the *index.html* using a web browswer like `Chrome` or `Edge`.

## Twist
This project was meant to serve as a **warm up**. For this reason, I decided to add a time limit for this project that was no more than `30 minutes`. It's worth mentioning, that this took me only *25 minutes* including the time for some of this documentation and a ton of testing and tweakings.

I won't lie, the `IntelliCode Completation` Extension helped me stylise my project's buttons and save a crap ton of time. Anyways, it's good to use such tools which saves the time for development.

I attempted this challenge starting from `20:55` to `21:13`, I did a bit of testing after it and google timer turned out to have `4:55` left.

## Result
Obviously, I was in a hurry so the code wasn't probably as optimized and ideal. But it definately *works* with even one comment inside the `script.js` file. I will not do any changes inside the `index.html`, `style.css` and `script.js` files. Have a look at those files.
